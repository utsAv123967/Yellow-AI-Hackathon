It does three things and then gets out of your way:

  1. Prints an orientation summary of the corpus, so you don't spend a morning
     writing the same counting code every other team is writing.
  2. Authors TWO metrics properly — including computing coverage FROM THE DATA
     rather than assuming it — and writes a schema-valid loop report.
  3. Tells you what it deliberately did NOT do.

It finds nothing. It diagnoses nothing. It refuses nothing. Those are the
interesting parts and they are yours. What this removes is the undifferentiated
work of getting to a file the scorer will accept.
